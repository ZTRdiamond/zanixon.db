# Module Installation
I did not upload this module to `npm` so to install it you can use the method below.

```bash
npm i github:zanixongroup/zanixon.db
```

I do not recommend that you use this module to be used as the main database and to store large data, it is feared that the data you store will be corrupt or damaged and therefore I also create database files that can be separated to be more flexible and not accumulate data in just one file.
